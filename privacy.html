<h1>Vapor App - Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Effective Date: 2025-10-13</p>

<div class="section">
  <h2>1. App Overview</h2>
  <p>"Vapor App" is a Flutter-based tool for vapor pressure calculations. It also supports ads and in-app purchases. Most computations are performed locally on the device.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>2. Data Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>The app collects minimal personal data only as necessary for app functionality and user experience enhancement:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Account Email & UID:</strong> Collected via Google Sign-In (Firebase Authentication) for user identification, subscription verification, and synchronization across devices. Data is securely stored in Firebase Firestore and transmitted over HTTPS.</li>
    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Collected via <code>device_info_plus</code> for app optimization and analytics.</li>
    <li><strong>In-App Purchases:</strong> Payment information is handled by Google Play Billing. The app does not store credit card information.</li>
    <li><strong>Ads:</strong> Google AdMob may collect device information, network information, and ad interaction data for personalized ad delivery and performance analysis. Users can reset Advertising ID or opt out of personalized ads in device settings.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
  <p>All sensitive information, including Google account email and UID, is transmitted securely over HTTPS and stored in Firebase with access controlled by Firebase Security Rules. Reasonable technical measures are in place to protect data from unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>4. User Rights</h2>
  <p>Users can request access to their personal data or request deletion. To do so, contact the developer (see Section 7). Deletion requests will remove the user's email and associated information from Firebase Firestore and generate a record for audit purposes.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>This app uses the following third-party services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google AdMob (ads)</li>
    <li>Google Play Billing (in-app purchases)</li>
    <li>Firebase (authentication, cloud storage, analytics)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each service has its own privacy policy, which users are encouraged to review:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy Policy</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>6. Ads and Personalization</h2>
  <p>Ads may be personalized based on device and usage data. The app does not collect personally identifiable information for advertising beyond what AdMob collects.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
